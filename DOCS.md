Challenging thinhgs I've done:

- Tried different solutions based on my goal. I tried bootstrap-react at first because my goal was fast styling. I tried and failed to get Bootstrap to completely cooperate, and could forsee problems developing with it given its limited documentation, so I switched over to Tailwind, and did not regret.
- Figured out how to customize Tailwind, and played around with designing responsively with my customized class names.


TOFIX:
- z index of navbar components
- figure out layout for posts
