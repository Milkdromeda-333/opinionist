# Opinionist

Opinionist is a website where a user can log in and share their opinions, comment, and vote and others opinions. I made this to practice integreating authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), and working with databases, and React and Tailwind to build the frontend.

Stack used: React, Express, MongoDB (MERN).

Technology used: Axios (HTTP requests), Tailwind (styling). Argon2 (password hashing).

I faced a lot of challenges, too many to name here. But, during the development process I kept a note of most of my challenges and how I overcame them [here](./DOCS.md). Notable lessons I learned from this project are:

- Don't wait so long to ask for help. You may feel good about figuring things out on your own, but asking for help will get you there faster. 

- Commit your code more often.

- Save time by having an MVP in mind.
